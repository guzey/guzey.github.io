This is a game called "RAPIDLY PRESS X TO REFUSE TO COME TO TERMS WITH YOUR OWN MORTALITY". It's written in pure JavaScript and it should work and look nice on pretty much any device (not counting tablets, oops!).

A huge thanks to MDN's tutorial "[2D breakout game using pure JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript)" for helping me to get started with the game!
