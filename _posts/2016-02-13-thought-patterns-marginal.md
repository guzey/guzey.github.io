title: Thought Patterns&#58; Marginal
---

**Problem:** you have a certain action you want to be doing but when the moment comes you forget about it or the trigger just never fully comes to your attention.

**Example:** Instead of postponing small tasks (e.g. taking out the trash) I want to do them immediately, but when they actually come, I forget about this intention and continue with whatever I was doing before i.e. telling myself I'll do them later.

**How to solve?** Make these if-else action plans to always be somewhere at the back of the mind, preferably not far from the working memory, always on the edge of awareness.

**Solution:** Anki deck with the maximum card interval of 1 day and long initial learning curve.

Why is this post called "marginal" and why should this work at all? Because the problem with the type of actions I described here is not that they're intrinsically hard, but the inertia. Frequent reminders of them by Anki should make it go away and substitute the old thought pattern with the new one without significant exertion of will.

Why use Anki instead of just daily reminders or something? Because there's a qualitative difference between recognition and recall. Seeing a reminder that tells you to do something brings it to your awareness for a moment and that's it. Seeing a "less than 3 minutes" card in Anki, makes you recall what you actually want to do and explicitly form the thought "If a task should take less than 3 minutes to complete, I will just do it instead of postponing it", which lasts much longer.

You can try this strategy out by [downloading my deck](../files/max_1_day.apkg) and adjusting it to your needs.
