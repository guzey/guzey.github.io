title: My Favorite Textbooks
---

I find most textbooks to be basically unreadable. Worse still, when I google "best X textbook", I frequently land on a "classic" textbook that feels like it was written by a fucking reptiloid for people with an entirely different from mine intelligence architecture. I hate formalism. I hate long mechanical derivations. I love thinking in pictures. I love intuitive, explainlikeim5 explanations. I believe that examples should precede definitions, not follow them. Finally, I have big troubles with working memory, which might explain most of the preceding stuff.

Thus, a list of my favorite textbooks/educational materials; all of them are either free or available on libgen.

**List so far**: linear algebra, calculus, multivariable calculus, topology, computation theory, microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics.

(if you feel that your learning style is similar to mine, do share your own favorite texts/materials not on this list!)

### Linear algebra

*[Lecture notes](https://files.vipulnaik.com/math-196/lecture-omnibus.pdf)* by Vipul Naik. Note: these notes are targeted at social science majors; all Vipul's course materials, including quizzes and answers to them are [here](https://vipulnaik.com/math-196/).

### Calculus

*Calculus* by Michael Spivak. Note: you absolutely need somebody to guide you/help with the problems from the book. The Correctâ„¢ way to self-study books like this is to email a professor at a local college and ask them if they could help you with stuff you don't understand and problems (hint: they will be happy to help).

### Multivariable calculus

*[Matec Notes](http://guzey.com/icef/2/matec/matec_notes.pdf)* by Alexey Guzey. Note: once I was so angry at the course's main textbook that I wrote my own set of lecture notes for it; naturally, it has an econ taste to it.

*[Lecture notes](http://files.vipulnaik.com/math-195/lecture-omnibus.pdf)* by Vipul Naik. Note: these notes are targeted at social science majors; all Vipul's course materials, including quizzes and answers to them are [here](https://vipulnaik.com/math-195/).

### Topology

*[Topology Without Tears](http://www.topologywithouttears.net/)* by Sidney A. Morris.

### Algorithms
[Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) by Tim Roughgarden. Note: this is a MOOC, not a textbook. But too good not to be included

### Computation Theory

*Introduction to the Theory of Computation* by Michael Sipser. Note: this book was the basis for the Algorithms-2 course I took at the university.

### Microeconomics

*Intermediate Microeconomics: A Modern Approach* by Hal Varian.

### Macroeconomics

*Macroeconomics* by Olivier Blanchard.

### Econometrics

*Introduction to Econometrics* by Christopher Dougherty. Note: lmk if you need solutions for it.
